# Mini Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of small Python projects!

These are simple programs I built while learning Python, focusing on practicing basic programming skills on python like loops, conditionals, functions, and working with user input.

## Why I Made This

I created this repository to document my journey as I learn Python and explore its unique features. While Iâ€™m already comfortable with programming in other languages, these projects help me build a deeper understanding of Python and expand my skill set.
